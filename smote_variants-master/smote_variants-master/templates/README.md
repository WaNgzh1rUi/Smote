# Experimenting with a new oversampler

This folder contains some sample code separated from the main package to enable the experimentation with a new oversampler

## Implement the oversampler

Take the ```_SMOTE_template.py``` file as a minimal working example of how to create a new oversampler, and populate the missing parts (including the core of the algorithm).

## Test the new oversampler

In order to check if the oversampler passes all edge cases, edit the ```test_template.ipynb``` notebook according to the instructions and execute it. If the oversampler can handle all edge cases, all tests should pass.
